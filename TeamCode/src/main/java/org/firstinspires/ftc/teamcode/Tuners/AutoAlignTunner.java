/*Step 1: Create the hand angle method in Diddy arm.
(MARK ONE SIDE OF claw AS THE HEAD)
- remeber dead zone of the servo(follow steps below based on dead zone being down. 0.5 mut be 90 degrees)
 When the claw is horizontal the claw at 0 deggress
 Vertical it is 90 degrees
 and then 180 when the head is the opposide direction then the 0
 */

 /*
 Step 2:
 desmos function to map angles of samples with degrees of hand

 Sample(x1) --> hand(y1)
  */

/*
Step 3:
Crete boolean which is red alliance or blue allance and test
 */






/*
Step A; Sub Auto

Build of the hand pipeline(needs to be done)

When the sample is straight
- Interpolate the hand and the turret

 */

/*
Step B: Pick up squence
